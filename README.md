# Monkey Patch


Yet another Alfred workflow updater via Alleyoop


First of all, credit due to [@phyllisstein](http://www.alfredforum.com/user/29-phyllisstein/) and his suggestion and workflow for [Alleyoop](http://www.alfredforum.com/topic/1582-alleyoop-update-alfred-workflows/).  This workflow is just my personal take on a workflow updater based on Alleyoop, made for fun.
 
Keyword is **mp**, then select an option listed.

Listing compatible workflows will display all workflows with Alleyoop support:

Checking for updates will list all available updates, you can Download all of them, or each one individually. Downloads are saved to your Downloads folder.

Information related to workflow updates are cached for a day/until the next time you log in. Use the  reset cache option to clean this up so you can force an update check. View log will open the folder that contains the Monkey Patch log.
